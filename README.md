# Diabetes Disease Classification

This Project focuses on diabetes, a group of metabolic disorders characterized by high blood sugar levels over an extended period. These disorders can lead to various symptoms, including frequent urination, increased thirst, and heightened hunger. If left untreated, diabetes can result in numerous complications, such as diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, which can be life-threatening. Additionally, serious long-term complications encompass cardiovascular disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, foot ulcers, and damage to the eyes.

## Objective 
The Objective of this project is to using Machine learning and Deep learning to classify one of dangerous Diabetes disease and implement this using Neural Network used in this training from scratch and understand the Mathematical concepts like Forward propagation, Back Progation, Activation Functions behind the Neural Networks.

## Dataset 

The Dataset is taken from Kaggle. It consist of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, pregnancies, Blood Pressure (BP), Diabetes Pedigree Function, Skin Thickness.

## Model used for training
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN) implemented from scratch using python and numpy.

## Model Evalution
- Accuracy: 99.07%

## Deployment 
-  Streamlit Cloud
-  Streamlit Web app: https://diabetes-disease-classification.streamlit.app/
